# Project Documentation - React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind

## Project Overview

This project is a web application built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The application provides a streamlined and responsive user interface, leveraging Tailwindâ€™s utility-first CSS framework for quick styling and customization. The use of Vite enables a fast development environment with HMR (Hot Module Replacement), making it ideal for building and scaling a high-performance front end. The core goal of this project is to develop a collection of reusable UI components, enhancing productivity and maintaining consistency across the application.
